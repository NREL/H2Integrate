# Frequently Asked Questions

## What are the goals and objectives of GreenHEART?

GreenHEART is a tool for modeling hybrid energy systems.
It is designed to be modular, flexible, and extensible, allowing users to model a wide variety of hybrid energy systems.

## How does GreenHEART differ from other tools?

GreenHEART is developed at NREL, which has a long history of developing high-quality tools for renewable energy systems.
Although there are many tools available for modeling hybrid energy systems, GreenHEART is unique in its focus on component-level modeling and design, as well as its modularity and extensibility.

[REopt](https://reopt.nrel.gov/tool) is similar to GreenHEART in that it models hybrid energy systems, though it is a much more high-level tool that focuses on optimization.
[SAM](https://sam.nrel.gov/) is another relevant tool (that GreenHEART partially uses), which has gives more detailed performance and financial modeling capabilities than REopt.
GreenHEART goes into more component-level details than those tools, especially in terms of physics-based modeling and design.
