        "# How to set up an analysis\n",
        "\n",
        "H2Integrate is designed so that you can run a basic analysis or design problem without extensive Python experience.\n",
        "The key inputs for the analysis are the configuration files, which are in YAML format.\n",
        "This doc page will walk you through the steps to set up a basic analysis, focusing on the different types of configuration files and how use them.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Top-level config file\n",
        "\n",
        "The top-level config file is the main entry point for H2Integrate.\n",
        "Its main purpose is to define the analysis type and the configuration files for the different components of the analysis.\n",
        "Here is an example of a top-level config file:\n",
        "\n",
        "```yaml\n",
        "name: H2Integrate_config\n",
        "\n",
        "system_summary: This reference hybrid plant is located in Minnesota and contains wind, solar, and battery storage technologies. The system is designed to produce hydrogen using an electrolyzer and also produce steel using a grid-connected plant.\n",
        "\n",
        "driver_config: driver_config.yaml\n",
        "technology_config: tech_config.yaml\n",
        "plant_config: plant_config.yaml\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "The top-level config file contains the following keys:\n",
        "- `name`: (optional) A name for the analysis. This is used to identify the analysis in the output files.\n",
        "- `system_summary`: (optional) A summary of the analysis. This helpful for quickly describing the analysis for documentation purposes.\n",
        "\n",
        "- `driver_config`: The path to the driver config file. This file defines the analysis type and the optimization settings.\n",
        "- `technology_config`: The path to the technology config file. This file defines the technologies included in the analysis, their modeling parameters, and the performance, cost, and financial models used for each technology.\n",
        "- `plant_config`: The path to the plant config file. This file defines the system configuration and how the technologies are connected together.\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal of the organization of the top-level config file is that it is easy to swap out different configurations for the analysis without having to change the code.\n",
        "For example, if you had different optimization problems, you could have different driver config files for each optimization problem and just change the `driver_config` key in the top-level config file to point to the new file.\n",
        "This allows you to quickly test different configurations and see how they affect the results.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Driver config file\n",
        "\n",
        "The driver config file defines the analysis type and the optimization settings.\n",
        "If you are running a basic analysis and not an optimization, the driver config file is quite straightforward and might look like this:\n",
        "\n",
        "```yaml\n",
        "name: driver_config\n",
        "description: This analysis runs a hybrid plant to match the first example in H2Integrate\n",

        "  folder_output: outputs\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "If you are running an optimization, the driver config file will contain additional keys to define the optimization settings, including design variables, constraints, and objective functions.\n",
        "Further details of more complex instances of the driver config file can be found in more advanced examples as they are developed.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Technology config file\n",
        "\n",
        "The technology config file defines the technologies included in the analysis, their modeling parameters, and the performance, cost, and financial models used for each technology.\n",
        "The yaml file is organized into sections for each technology included in the analysis under the `technologies` heading.\n",
