# Included technologies

H2Integrate comes pre-installed with many technology modules, based on NREL modeling.
These technologies span a wide range of Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) and as such, the certainty in the performance and cost modeling is highly dependent on which technology is being modeled.
Additionally, the level of life cycle assessment (LCA) that has been performed for each technology varies greatly.
Here, these technology models are divided into two categories: commercial-ready models and research and development technologies.
For the commercial-ready models, all of the performance, cost, and LCA models have been validated with real-world deployment data.
For the reasearch and development (R&D) models, systems have not yet been produced at commercial scale, or data is not yet publicly available to validate their results.
