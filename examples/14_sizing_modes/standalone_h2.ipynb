        "# Demonstrating different compute modes with standalone H2 electrolyzer\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook shows how to use different compute modes (`normal`, `feedstock_size`, and `product_size`) using a simple system with only one complex converter, and two simple converters connected to it.\n",
        "These simple converters are the new `feedstock_profile` and `product_profile` class, and simply function as dictated energy/mass flow profiles that can be set in a .csv rather than calculated by a model.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Compute modes\n",
        "\n",
        "For the converters involved in this example, three different `compute_mode` parameters have been defined, which determine how the `PerformanceModel.compute()` function will execute and which variables to create in the `PerformanceModel.setup()` function.\n",
        "\n",
        "- `normal`: In this mode, converters function as they always have previously:\n",
        "    - The size of the asset is fixed within the `compute()` function, and is read from the config.\n",
        "    - The feedstock profiles are fixed and set as the `<feedstock>_in` inputs, typically from a connection to another upstream converter.\n",
        "    - The product profiles are calculated and set as the `<product>_out` outputs, and may be passed to another downstream converter.\n",
        "- `feedstock_size`: In this mode, the size of the asset is adjusted to be able to utilize all of the available feedstock:\n",
        "    - The size of the asset is *calculated* within the `compute()` function, by how big it needs to be to utilize all of the `<feedstock>_in`.\n",
        "    - The feedstock profiles are fixed and set as the `<feedstock>_in` inputs, typically from a connection to another upstream converter - same as `normal` mode.\n",
        "    - The product profiles are calculated and set as the `<product>_out` outputs, and may be passed to another downstream converter - same as `normal` mode.\n",
        "- `product_size`: In this mode, the size of the asset is adjusted to be able to meet the demand profile for its product:\n",
        "    - The size of the asset is calculated within the `compute()` function, by how big it needs to be to provide all of the `<product>_demand` - a new input that is defined in `setup()` just for this mode.\n",
        "    - The feedstock profiles are *calculated* and set as the `<feedstock>_consume` *outputs*, and may be passed to another upstream converter.\n",
        "    - The product profiles are *fixed* and set as the `<product>_demand` *inputs*, typically from a connection to another downstream converter.\n",

        "\n",
        "Here, there are three technologies in the the `tech_config.yaml`: And `electrolyzer`, a `feedstock_profile` (configured for electricity), and a `product_profile` (configured for hydrogen).\n",
        "The feedstock/product profiles are very simple converters that are set up to either read a .csv file that defines the profile OR function as a flexible input/output source of the commodity.\n",
        "In both cases, a simple buying or selling price is set for the commodity to feed into financial calculations.\n",
