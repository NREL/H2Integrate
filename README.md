Hybrid project power-to-x component-level system performance and financial modeling for control and
design optimization. GreenHEART currently includes renewable energy, hydrogen, ammonia, and steel.
Other elements such as desalination systems, pipelines, compressors, and storage systems can also be
included as needed.


## Publications where GreenHEART has been used

For more context about GreenHEART and to see analyses that have been performed using the tool, please see some of these publications.
PDFs are available in the linked titles.

### Nationwide techno-economic analysis of clean hydrogen production powered by a hybrid renewable energy plant for over 50,000 locations in the United States.
The levelized cost of hydrogen is calculated for varying technology costs, and tax credits to explore cost sensitivities independent of plant design, performance, and site selection.
Our findings suggest that strategies for cost reduction include selecting sites with abundant wind resources, complementary wind and solar resources, and optimizing the sizing of wind and solar assets to maximize the hybrid plant capacity factor.

### Exploring the role of producing low-carbon hydrogen using water electrolysis powered by offshore wind in facilitating the United States’ transition to a net-zero emissions economy by 2050.
Conducting a regional techno-economic analysis at four U.S. coastal sites, the study evaluates two energy transmission configurations and examines associated costs for the years 2025, 2030, and 2035.
The results highlight that locations using fixed-bottom technology may achieve cost-competitive water electrolysis hydrogen production by 2030 through leveraging geologic hydrogen storage and federal policy incentives.

### Examining how tightly-coupled gigawatt-scale wind- and solar-sourced H2 depends on the ability to store and deliver otherwise-curtailed H2 during times of shortages.
Modeling results suggest that the levelized cost of storage is highly spatially heterogeneous, with minor impact on the cost of H2 in the Midwest, and potentially significant impact in areas with emerging H2 economies such as Central California and the Southeast. While TOL/MCH may be the cheapest aboveground bulk storage solution evaluated, upfront capital costs, modest energy efficiency, reliance on critical materials, and greenhouse gas emissions from heating remain concerns.

## Software requirements

- Python version 3.9, 3.10, 3.11 64-bit
- Other versions may still work, but have not been extensively tested at this time

## Installing from Package Repositories

```bash
pip install greenheart
```

## Installing from Source

### Easiest approach (recommended)

1. Using Git, navigate to a local target directory and clone repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/NREL/GreenHEART.git
    ```

2. Navigate to `GreenHEART`

    ```bash
    cd GreenHEART
    ```

3. Create a conda environment and install GreenHEART and all its dependencies

    ```bash
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    ```

4. Install Cbc.
   1. If using a Unix machine (not Windows), install a final dependency

        ```bash
        conda install -y -c conda-forge coin-or-cbc=2.10.8
        ```
    
    2. Windows users will have to manually install Cbc: https://github.com/coin-or/Cbc

An additional step can be added if additional dependencies are required, or you plan to use this
environment for development work.

- Pass `-e` for an editable developer install
- Use one of the extra flags as needed:
  - `examples`: allows you to use the Jupyter Notebooks
  - `develop`: adds developer and documentation tools
  - `all` simplifies adding all the dependencies

This looks like the following for a developer installation:

```bash
pip install -e ".[all]"
```

### Customizable

1. Using Git, navigate to a local target directory and clone repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/NREL/GreenHEART.git
    ```

2. Navigate to `GreenHEART`

    ```bash
    cd GreenHEART
    ```

3. Create a new virtual environment and change to it. Using Conda Python 3.11 (choose your favorite
   supported version) and naming it 'greenheart' (choose your desired name):

    ```bash
    conda create --name greenheart python=3.11 -y
    conda activate greenheart
    ```

4. Install GreenHEART and its dependencies:

    ```bash
    conda install -y -c conda-forge glpk
    pip install ProFAST@git+https://github.com/NREL/ProFAST.git
    ```

    Note: Unix users should install Cbc via:

    ```bash
    conda install -y -c conda-forge coin-or-cbc=2.10.8
    ```

    Windows users will have to manually install Cbc: https://github.com/coin-or/Cbc.

    - If you want to just use GreenHEART:

       ```bash
       pip install .  
       ```

    - If you want to work with the examples:

       ```bash
       pip install ".[examples]"
       ```

    - If you also want development dependencies for running tests and building docs:  

       ```bash
       pip install -e ".[develop]"
       ```

    - In one step, all dependencies can be installed as:

      ```bash
      pip install -e ".[all]"
      ```

1. The functions which download resource data require an NREL API key. Obtain a key from:

    [https://developer.nrel.gov/signup/](https://developer.nrel.gov/signup/)

2. To set up the `NREL_API_KEY` and `NREL_API_EMAIL` required for resource downloads, you can create
   Environment Variables called `NREL_API_KEY` and `NREL_API_EMAIL`. Otherwise, you can keep the key
   in a new file called ".env" in the root directory of this project.

    Create a file ".env" that contains the single line:

    ```bash
    NREL_API_KEY=key
    NREL_API_EMAIL=your.name@email.com
    ```

3. Verify setup by running tests:

    ```bash
    pytest
    ```


2. To set up `NREL_API_KEY` for resource downloads, first refer to section 7 and 8 above. But for
   the `.env` file method, the file should go in the working directory of your Python project, e.g.
   directory from where you run `python`.

## Parallel processing for GreenHEART finite differences and design of experiments

GreenHEART is set up to run in parallel using MPI and PETSc for finite differencing and for design of
experiments runs through OpenMDAO. To use this capability you will need to follow the addtional installation
instruction below:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge mpi4py petsc4py
```

For more details on implementation and installation, reference the documentation for OpenMDAO.

To to check that your installation is working, do the following:

```bash
cd tests/greenheart/
mpirun -n 2 pytest test_openmdao_mpi.py
```

## Getting Started

The [Examples](./examples/) contain Jupyter notebooks and sample YAML files for common usage
scenarios in GreenHEART. These are actively maintained and updated to demonstrate GreenHEART's
capabilities. For full details on simulation options and other features, documentation is
forthcoming.
